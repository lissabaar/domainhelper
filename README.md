### A tool for adding and configuring domains in Cloudflare automatically

To save me a huge amount of time I wrote and now use this project for my work where I have to configure sometimes up to 30 domains at once, all with the same settings like turning on HTTPS rewrites, checking browser integrity, adding a bunch of DNS records etc. It uses Cloudflare API.
